## ðŸ“ˆ Project Leap

Project Leap is a Reactâ€“powered dataâ€‘dashboard platform that lets teams securely publish, share, and visualize Google Sheets in a beautiful, easyâ€‘toâ€‘use interface. With a simple login wall and perâ€‘user management of spreadsheets, Project Leap transforms raw sheet URLs into interactive, realâ€‘time dashboardsâ€”no spreadsheet skills required.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Secure Access:** Builtâ€‘in authentication ensures only your team can view or add spreadsheets.
- **Dynamic Onboarding:** Users can add any Google Sheets link; ProjectÂ Leap automatically fetches and displays its data.
- **Polished Visuals:** Outâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘box line, bar, and pie charts powered by Chart.js (or Recharts) bring spreadsheets to life.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean React pages & API routes separate concernsâ€”auth, data fetching, and chart rendering.
- **Easy Deployment:** Deploy on Vercel (or Netlify) with a few environment variablesâ€”no serverâ€‘management headache.

Whether you need a quick overview of sales numbers, a project tracker, or an executive summaryâ€”Project Leap makes it effortless to turn spreadsheet data into actionable insights. Get started by cloning this repo, configuring your Google Service Account and database, and watching your sheets soar!
